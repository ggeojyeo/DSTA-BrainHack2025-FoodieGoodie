## **What is FoodieGoodie?**
FoodieGoodie is a mobile app that empowers Singaporeans to tackle food insecurity during crises. It features an AI-powered substitution engine that suggests available alternatives when items are out of stock. A community-sharing hub connects donors with those in need through scheduled, location-based pickups. The app also includes a personalised supply checklist and tracking system based on household size, helping users monitor their stock based on a questionnaire that they will be asked to fill up during sign-up. With FoodieGoodie, citizens can prepare, adapt, and support one another, strengthening resilience from the ground up in times of uncertainty.
